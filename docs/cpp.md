## Overview

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created as an extension of the C programming language.

## Key Features

- **Object-oriented**: C++ supports the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
- **Memory management**: C++ provides manual memory management through pointers, allowing for fine-grained control over memory allocation and deallocation.
- **Performance critical applications**: C++ is designed for building high-performance applications, making it a popular choice for systems programming, game development, and other performance-critical domains.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: C++ provides the STL, a comprehensive library of containers, algorithms, and iterators that simplify programming tasks.

## Example

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Hello, C++!" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
